Very nice implementation of Tufte's quartile-frame scatterplot by Mikhail Popov, as [posted](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/ggplot2/mtdZtMKG5qI) on the ggplot2 mailing list. Rather than explaining what it is, have a look at the self-explanatory figure (by Mikhail Popov)

His code is available on [github](https://github.com/bearloga/Quartile-frame-Scatterplot).
