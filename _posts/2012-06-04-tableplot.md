The [`tabplot`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tabplot/index.html) package by Martijn Tennekes and Edwin de Jonge has a nice function, `tableplot`, that allows to generate an summary figure for `data.frame`, `data.table` and `ffdf` objects. Nice illustrative and colourful illustrations in the function's example. W. Andrew Barr has a [short post](http://www.ancienteco.com/2012/05/quickly-visualize-your-whole-dataset.html) about the function.
