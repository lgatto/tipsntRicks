### Organise your code
[Organizing R source code][1] and [How to organize large R
programs][2] on stackoverflow. Although not directly related to R, this
[BioStar question about files and directories management][3] is nice.

### Managing projects
[ProjectTemplate][4], inspired from Ruby on Rails, to create a project
template structure.

### Do the logging
[Logging][5] under R.

### Statistical workflows 
[How to efficiently manage a statistical analysis
project?][6] question from StackExchange's Statistical Analysis, with lots of
useful hints and references and [How does software development compare with
statistical programming/analysis][7] on stackoverflow. Also, [How do you
combine 'Revision Control' with 'WorkFlow' for R][8] and [Workflow for
statistical analysis and report writing][9] on stackoverflow.

### Reproducible research
And there is of course [Sweave][10], [org-mode][11] and [org-babel][12] modes
for _high-level_ or process documentation.

### Version control/revision control 
[R and version control for the solo data analyst][13] and 
[How do you combine 'Revision Control' with 'WorkFlow' for
R][8] on stackoverflow.
