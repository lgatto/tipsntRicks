### R (and S) names.

This is a short summary of a [thread](http://n4.nabble.com/R-S-S-Plus-whence-comes-thy-name-tt1692090.html) of the R mailing list. I found it interesting and thought that it might be helpful to keep track of it here. 

From [http://stat.bell-labs.com/S/](http://stat.bell-labs.com/S/) and [http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/doc/94.11.ps](http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/doc/94.11.ps) by Rick Becker: "By July, 1976, we decided to name the system. Acronyms were in abundance at Bell Laboratories, so it seemed sure that we would come up with one for our system, but no one seemed to be able to agree with any one else's suggestion: Interactive SCS (ISCS), Statistical Computing System (too confusing), Statistical Analysis System (already taken), etc. In the end, we decided that all of these names contained an 'S' and, with the C programming language as a precedent, decided to name the system 'S'. (We dropped the quotes by 1979)." (posted by Ben Bolker)


From the FAQ 2.12 [Why is R named R?](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-is-R-named-R_003f): "The name is partly based on the (first) names of the first two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the Bell Labs language 'S' (see What is S?)."
