### The S4 system

[Sources on S4 objects in R][1] question on SO includes nice S4 documentation.

From the R mailing list [S4 classes and debugging - Is there a summary?][2]
and [Slot assignment in S4 classes][3]

[The S4 object system][4] by Hadley Wickham.

### The S3 system

[Short S3 overview][5] by ygc on R bloggers.

[The S3 object system][6] by Hadley Wickham.

[Safely creating S3 generic functions using `setGenericS3()`][7] by Henrik Bengtsson

### And more...

[Object oriented programming in R][8] Google search results.

[Object Oriented Design(s) in R][9] slideshow by [Romain Francois][10],
including lexical scoping, S3, S4, the new R5 reference classes and C++.
[Here][11] is the video that features in its second part these OO topics. The
first part is about integrating R with C++.

From the R mailing list [S3 vs S4][12], [Abstract classes][13] and [A primitive OO in R -- where next?][14].

[r-proto][15] Prototype-based model of object oriented programming for R programmers.

[The R.oo package][16] and [Programming with References][17],
