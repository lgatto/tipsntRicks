See these posts ([1](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioconductor/2006-June/013486.html), [2](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.informatics.conductor/4258/match=)) from the Bioc mailing list for the removal of probes in `CEL` files. [This](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.informatics.conductor/4242/match=) post points to the effect of this on some downstream analysis (here GCRMA normalisation). 
Note that [affxparser](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/affxparser.html) also has most certainly has similar capabilities.
